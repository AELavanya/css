            plays well with others;
            runs everywhere;

            <p style="font-size: large;">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
